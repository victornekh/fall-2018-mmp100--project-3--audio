# Project 3 — Audio
For this project, you’ll use Audacity to create a 90-second audio collage that is based on a combination of your own audio samples plus free audio samples from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/audio), [Freesound](https://freesound.org), [CCMixter](http://ccmixter.org), and/or [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/search/sounds?filter.license=to_modify_commercially). Your collage can be anything you want: music, nature, interview, etc. We’ll listen to your work in class on Saturday, 17 November 2018.

## Before You Begin
* Make sure the names of all files and folders are in **lower case**.  
* Make sure the names of all files and folders use **only dashes** to delimit words.  

## Instructions
1. Mixdown your project to a stereo file in MP3 format. For example, if you create a project called `stairway-to-heaven`, then you’d name the file `stairway-to-heaven.mp3`.
2. Create a folder in your MMP server account for your project. For example, if your name was Jimmy Page, you’d create a folder called [`http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/jimmy.page/fall-2018/mmp-100/project-3/`](http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/jimmy.page/fall-2018/mmp-100/project-3/).
3. Using FileZilla, upload your Audacity project and the mixdown file to the folder you created in the previous step. For example, if you had created a project called `stairway-to-heaven`, then you’d need to upload `stairway-to-heaven.aup`, `stairway-to-heaven_data`, and `stairway-to-heaven.mp3` to [`http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/jimmy.page/fall-2018/mmp-100/project-3/`](http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/jimmy.page/fall-2018/mmp-100/project-3/).
4. Inside the `project-3` folder, create an `index.html` file, add your full name, the name of the project, and a link to the MP3 file using the `audio` element.
5. Edit this `README.md` file by adding a link to your project under the **Link** section and include a description under the **Description** section. Both appear below.
